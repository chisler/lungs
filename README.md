## What's in the box

Schema file, built on top of JSONSchema, defines everything:
1. Autocompletions

1. How data is interpreted into visualization.

## Known issues

1. Logic must be moved from reducers to middleware.
1. Diff should be provided in the app, before creating the pull request.
1. Chord graph vertices' names can be diplayed with distortion.
